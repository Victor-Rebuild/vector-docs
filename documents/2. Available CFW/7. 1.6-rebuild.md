## What is 1.6-rebuild?

1.6-rebuild is a continuation of Vector firmware 1.6, 1.6 is considered to be the best Vector firmware version because it's the last version made by anki and has a higher activity level compared to other later firmware versions. However it isn't perfect, with 1.6 being older it has more bugs compared to newer firmwares and is missing out on some features. This is where I came in, since late July of 2025 I've been working on porting features from newer Vector firmwares such as 1.8's custom eye colors and 2.0's Vector 2.0 support over to 1.6 while making sure to keep the charm of 1.6. - Switch-modder
